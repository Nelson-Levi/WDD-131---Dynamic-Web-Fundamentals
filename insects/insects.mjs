Found across North America, this butterfly thrives in open fields, gardens, and meadows. Its caterpillars feed primarily on plants like everlasting and cudweed, which also serve as host plants for laying eggs. Adults enjoy nectar from various flowers, including aster, goldenrod, and milkweed.",
    lifeCycle:
      "The life cycle of the American Lady butterfly begins with the female laying eggs singly on the leaves of host plants such as everlasting and cudweed. The eggs hatch into spiny, black-and-yellow caterpillars that feed on the host plants while building protective silk nests. After growing through several instars, the caterpillars form a chrysalis Inside the chrysalis, metamorphosis occurs, transforming the caterpillar into an adult butterfly with vivid orange and black wings.",

It plays an important role in its ecosystem, not only as prey but also as a pollinator for nocturnal flowers in its habitat.",
  lifeCycle: 
    "Eggs are laid on host plants, and larvae feed on herbs and shrubs, growing through several molts. The caterpillars, often covered in fine hairs, may also possess chemical defenses to deter predators. Once mature, the larvae pupate, emerging as adults to reproduce. Pupation occurs in sheltered locations, such as under leaf litter or in loose soil, where they are protected during metamorphosis. The cycle repeats, with multiple generations possible in warmer climates, allowing the population to thrive in diverse conditions. Adults are most active during the spring and summer, synchronizing their emergence with the availability of food and optimal mating conditions."

    about: 
    "The seven spotted lady beetle (Coccinella septempunctata) is a beneficial insect known for its red body with seven black spots. Native to Europe but introduced worldwide, it is a natural predator of aphids and other agricultural pests, making it an important ally in pest control. This beetle is commonly found in gardens, fields, and agricultural areas, where its presence helps maintain ecological balance. Its vibrant coloration serves as a warning to predators, signaling the presence of distasteful or toxic chemicals in its body. The seven spotted lady beetle has become a symbol of good luck in many cultures and is celebrated for its vital role in sustainable agriculture.",
  lifeCycle: 
    "The life cycle starts with eggs laid on plants infested with aphids. Larvae emerge and feed voraciously, growing quickly through several molts before pupating. During the larval stage, they consume large quantities of pests, making them highly effective at pest control. Pupation takes place on plant surfaces, where the larvae transform into adults over the course of a few days. Adults emerge, continuing to feed and reproduce, helping control pest populations in the process. The life cycle can repeat several times a year in warmer climates, ensuring a steady presence of these helpful beetles."
