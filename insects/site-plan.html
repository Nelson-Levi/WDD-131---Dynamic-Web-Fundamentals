            <img src="./images/icon-images/american-lady-butterfly-icon.jpeg" alt="American Lady Butterfly">

The American Lady butterfly (Vanessa virginiensis) is a striking species known for its vibrant orange and black wings, adorned with white spots and blue eyespots on the hindwings. Found across North America, this butterfly thrives in open fields, gardens, and meadows. Its caterpillars feed primarily on plants like everlasting and cudweed, which also serve as host plants for laying eggs. Adults enjoy nectar from various flowers, including aster, goldenrod, and milkweed.

The life cycle of the American Lady butterfly begins with the female laying eggs singly on the leaves of host plants such as everlasting and cudweed. The eggs hatch into spiny, black-and-yellow caterpillars that feed on the host plants while building protective silk nests. After growing through several instars, the caterpillars form a chrysalis Inside the chrysalis, metamorphosis occurs, transforming the caterpillar into an adult butterfly with vivid orange and black wings.

The bee fly Systoechus is a fascinating insect known for its resemblance to bees, with a fuzzy body and long proboscis. This mimicry helps protect it from predators while it feeds on nectar from flowers, playing a role in pollination. Found in various habitats, including deserts and grasslands, these flies are often seen hovering near flowers. Despite their gentle appearance, they are parasitic in their larval stage, targeting other insect species.

The life cycle of the Systoechus bee fly begins with females laying eggs near the nests or burrows of host insects, such as solitary bees or wasps. Once hatched, the larvae seek out and infiltrate the host's nest to feed on the eggs, larvae, or provisions stored by the host. This parasitic relationship is crucial for their development, as it provides the necessary resources for growth. After completing their larval stage, they pupate and emerge as adult bee flies, ready to mate and continue the cycle.

<img src="./images/icon-images/black-blister-beetle-icon.jpg" alt="Black Blister Beetle">

The black blister beetle (Epicauta pennsylvanica) is a sleek, black insect known for its elongated body and toxic defense mechanism. Found in gardens, fields, and meadows across North America, it can release cantharidin, a chemical that causes skin irritation or blisters when handled. These beetles are both scavengers and herbivores, feeding on plants like alfalfa and weeds. They play a complex role in ecosystems, sometimes damaging crops but also affecting the populations of other insects.

The life cycle of the black blister beetle begins with females laying eggs in the soil, often near grasshopper egg pods, which the larvae will parasitize. Upon hatching, the larvae (triungulins) actively seek out and feed on grasshopper eggs, their primary food source. After consuming the eggs, the larvae undergo multiple stages of development before pupating in the soil. The adult beetles emerge from the pupae, completing their transformation and beginning the search for mates and food.

<img src="./images/icon-images/blackberry-looper-icon.jpeg" alt="Blackberry Looper">

The blackberry looper (Chlorochlamys chloroleucaria) is a small green moth with delicate, scalloped wings that often have subtle, wavy patterns. Found across North America, it is commonly associated with forests, gardens, and areas where blackberry plants grow. Its caterpillars are inchworms, named for their looping movement, and feed on the leaves of blackberry and other shrubs. While their feeding can occasionally damage plants, they are also an important food source for birds and other predators.

The life cycle of the blackberry looper begins with the moth laying eggs on the leaves of host plants such as blackberry bushes. After hatching, the caterpillars feed on the leaves, using their distinctive inching motion to move between feeding sites. Once fully grown, the caterpillars pupate in the soil or within leaf litter, transforming into adult moths. These moths emerge to mate and lay eggs, completing the cycle. 

<img src="./images/hero-images/carolina-locust-hero.webp" alt="Carolina Locust">
<img src="./images/icon-images/carolina-locust-icon.jpg" alt="Carolina Locust">

The Carolina locust (Dissosteira carolina) is a grasshopper species known for its camouflaged appearance, with mottled brown and gray wings that help it blend into its surroundings. It is commonly found in dry, open areas like fields, roadsides, and gravelly habitats across North America. When disturbed, it displays striking black hindwings edged with pale yellow as it flies in short bursts. This locust feeds primarily on grasses and weeds, making it an important grazer in its ecosystem.

The life cycle of the Carolina locust begins when females deposit eggs in sandy or loose soil in late summer or fall. The eggs overwinter and hatch in spring, producing nymphs that go through several molts as they grow. These nymphs resemble miniature adults but lack fully developed wings until their final molt. Once mature, adults mate, and the females lay eggs, continuing the cycle.

<img src="./images/hero-images/colorado-potato-beetle-hero.jpeg" alt="Colorado Potato Beetle">
<img src="./images/icon-images/colorado-potato-beetle-icon.jpeg" alt="Colorado Potato Beetle">

The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) is a notorious agricultural pest, recognized by its rounded yellow body with distinctive black stripes on its wing covers. Native to North America, it primarily feeds on potato plants but can also damage other members of the nightshade family, like tomatoes and eggplants. This beetle is known for its rapid reproduction and ability to develop resistance to chemical pesticides, making it a significant challenge for farmers.

The life cycle of the Colorado potato beetle begins when females lay clusters of bright orange eggs on the undersides of host plant leaves. The eggs hatch into larvae, which feed voraciously on the leaves, causing extensive defoliation. After several molts, the larvae drop to the soil to pupate, emerging later as adult beetles. Adults overwinter in the soil, becoming active again in spring to restart the cycle. 

<img src="./images/hero-images/crane-fly-hero.jpeg" alt="Crane Fly">
<img src="./images/icon-images/crane-fly-icon.jpg" alt="Crane Fly">

The crane fly, often mistaken for a large mosquito, belongs to the family Tipulidae and is known for its long, slender legs and delicate wings. These harmless insects are commonly found near water sources, grasslands, and gardens, playing a role in ecosystem health. Adult crane flies generally do not eat, with some subsisting on nectar, while others do not feed at all during their short lifespan. Their larvae, called leatherjackets, are soil-dwelling and feed on decaying organic matter, roots, and grass.

The life cycle of a crane fly begins when females lay eggs in moist soil or water. These eggs hatch into larvae, which are worm-like and thrive in damp environments, feeding on organic matter and plant roots. After several growth stages, the larvae pupate in the soil, undergoing metamorphosis. Adult crane flies emerge from the pupae, mate, and lay eggs, completing the cycle.

<img src="./images/hero-images/emerald-ash-borer-hero.jpeg" alt="Emerald Ash Borer">
<img src="./images/icon-images/emerald-ash-borer-icon.jpeg" alt="Emerald Ash Borer">

The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) is a striking metallic-green beetle native to Asia, now infamous as an invasive pest in North America. It primarily targets ash trees, boring into their bark to lay eggs, which leads to the destruction of the tree's vascular system. This beetle has devastated millions of ash trees, significantly altering forest ecosystems and causing economic losses in affected areas. Adults feed on ash tree leaves, but their damage is minor compared to the larval impact. 

The life cycle of the emerald ash borer begins when females lay eggs in crevices of ash tree bark. The eggs hatch into larvae, which burrow into the tree and create winding tunnels in the inner bark as they feed. This activity disrupts the tree’s ability to transport water and nutrients, eventually killing it. After overwintering as larvae, they pupate in spring and emerge as adults to restart the cycle.

<img src="./images/hero-images/galium-sphinx-moth-hero.jpeg" alt="Galium Sphinx Moth">
<img src="./images/icon-images/galium-sphinx-moth-icon.jpg" alt="Galium Sphinx Moth">

The Galium sphinx moth (Hyles gallii), also known as the bedstraw hawk-moth, is a striking species found in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. This moth is known for its streamlined body, olive-green forewings, and vibrant pink hindwings, making it a favorite among moth enthusiasts. It frequents open fields, gardens, and forest edges, where its caterpillars feed on plants. The adults are primarily nocturnal and feed on nectar, often hovering like hummingbirds while feeding.

The life cycle of the Galium sphinx moth starts with the female laying eggs on the leaves of host plants. The caterpillars, which are typically green or black with distinctive eye spots, emerge and feed voraciously on foliage. After reaching full size, they pupate in the soil or leaf litter, undergoing metamorphosis.

<img src="./images/hero-images/green-lacewing-hero.jpeg" alt="Green Lacewing">
<img src="./images/icon-images/green-lacewing-icon.jpeg" alt="Green Lacewing">

The green lacewing (Chrysopa viridissima) is a delicate insect known for its translucent, pale green wings that have a net-like pattern, making it easily identifiable. It is commonly found in gardens, forests, and agricultural areas, where it plays a beneficial role in controlling pest populations. Both the adult lacewing and its larvae are predators, feeding on a wide variety of soft-bodied insects such as aphids, mites, and whiteflies. These insects are highly regarded by gardeners and farmers for their natural pest control abilities. 

The life cycle of the green lacewing begins with the female laying clusters of eggs on slender stalks, which help protect the eggs from predators. The eggs hatch into larvae, which are voracious predators, feeding on pests like aphids and other small insects. After several molts, the larvae pupate in a cocoon, which may be attached to leaves or hidden in debris. Adult lacewings emerge from the pupae, mate, and the females lay new eggs, restarting the cycle.

<img src="./images/hero-images/io-moth-hero.jpg" alt="Io Moth">
<img src="./images/icon-images/io-moth-icon.jpeg" alt="Io Moth">

The Io moth (Automeris io) is a striking nocturnal insect known for its large, colorful appearance and distinctive eye spots on its hindwings, which resemble owl eyes. These eye spots serve as a defense mechanism, deterring predators by creating the illusion of a larger, more intimidating creature. The moth is found in North and South America, inhabiting woodlands, forests, and gardens. Its larvae, known as caterpillars, feed on a wide range of plants, including members of the cashew and sumac families.

The life cycle of the Io moth begins when the female lays eggs on the leaves of host plants, typically in the summer. The larvae hatch and begin feeding, growing quickly through several molts, and are often brightly colored with spiny projections. Once fully grown, the larvae pupate, typically in leaf litter or soil, undergoing a metamorphosis into adults. Adult moths emerge, often after several weeks, and are most active at night.

<img src="./images/hero-images/katydid-hero.jpeg" alt="Katydid">
<img src="./images/icon-images/katydid-icon.jpeg" alt="Katydid">

The katydid is a type of grasshopper-like insect known for its long, slender body and long antennae. They are typically green or brown, with adaptations that help them blend into their surroundings, making them excellent at camouflage among leaves and vegetation. Found in a variety of habitats, including gardens, meadows, forests, and fields, katydids are most active during warm, humid weather and are known for their distinctive mating calls, which sound like "katy-did" or "katy-do."

The life cycle of the katydid begins with the female laying eggs in plant stems, leaves, or soil. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which closely resemble miniature adults but lack wings and undergo several molts as they grow. As they mature, katydids develop wings and reproductive organs, allowing them to join the adult population and reproduce. The adult females lay eggs, and the cycle starts over. 

<img src="./images/hero-images/march-brown-mayfly-hero.jpg" alt="March Brown Mayfly">
<img src="./images/icon-images/march-brown-mayfly-icon.jpeg" alt="March Brown Mayfly icon">


The March brown mayfly (Rhithrogena germanica) is a large and distinctive mayfly species often found in freshwater habitats like rivers, streams, and lakes. Known for its brownish color, the adult mayfly has delicate wings with a characteristic mottled pattern, and it is most commonly observed during the spring months, typically from March to May, hence the name. As an aquatic insect, the larvae (nymphs) spend most of their lives in the water. The adult stage is short-lived, with adults having no functional mouthparts and surviving only long enough to mate and reproduce.

The life cycle of the March brown mayfly begins when females lay their eggs in the water, where they hatch into nymphs. The nymphs live in the water, undergoing several molts as they grow and mature, sometimes for up to a year or more, depending on the environmental conditions. Once they are fully grown, the nymphs emerge from the water, transforming into winged adults in a process called emergence. The adult mayflies live for only a few days, during which time they mate, lay eggs, and then die. 

<img src="./images/hero-images/red-cross-shield-bug-hero.jpg" alt="Red Cross Shield Bug">
<img src="./images/icon-images/red-cross-shield-bug-icon.jpeg" alt="Red Cross Shield Bug">

The red cross shield bug (Carpocoris fuscispinus) is a striking insect known for its distinctive shield-like shape and vibrant coloration. This species is typically found in gardens, woodlands, and agricultural areas across Europe and parts of Asia. The adult shield bug is often recognized by its reddish-brown body with dark markings, resembling a cross on its back, hence its name. Like other shield bugs, it feeds primarily on plant sap, using its piercing-sucking mouthparts to extract nutrients from leaves and stems. 

The life cycle of the red cross shield bug begins when the female lays clusters of eggs on the undersides of leaves or stems. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which resemble small, wingless versions of the adults. These nymphs undergo several molts as they grow, gradually developing their characteristic color and shape. As they mature, the nymphs form wings and reach adulthood, ready to mate and start the cycle over.

<img src="./images/hero-images/two-striped-grasshopper-hero.jpg" alt="Two-Striped Grasshopper">
<img src="./images/icon-images/two-striped-grasshopper-icon.jpg" alt="Two-Striped Grasshopper">

The two-striped grasshopper (Melanoplus bivittatus) is a common grasshopper species found throughout North America, particularly in fields, grasslands, and agricultural areas. It is easily identified by the two distinctive, longitudinal black stripes running along its light brown or greenish body. This grasshopper is an herbivore, feeding on a wide range of grasses, crops, and weeds, which can sometimes lead to damage in agricultural settings. Its strong, powerful hind legs allow it to leap long distances when disturbed. 

The life cycle of the two-striped grasshopper begins with the female laying clusters of eggs in the soil, typically during the late summer or fall. These eggs overwinter in the soil and hatch in early spring when temperatures warm up. The newly emerged nymphs resemble miniature adults but lack fully developed wings. Over the next few weeks, the nymphs undergo several molts, growing larger and developing wings as they approach adulthood. Once mature, the adult grasshoppers mate, and the cycle repeats with the next generation of eggs being laid.
